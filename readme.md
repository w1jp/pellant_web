This is a basic HTML/CSS/JS website using bootstrap 5. Open an [issue](https://github.com/w1jp/pellant_web/issues) if you want to add something. If you are comfortable with Bootstrap and want to contribute, let me know and I'll add you to collaborators and you can branch this and submit a pull request.
